## MNIST Digit CLassification using a 2 Layer Neural Network

This project addresses the challenge of handwritten digit recognition using a two-layer neural network architecture. The objective is to create a model capable of accurately classifying grayscale images of handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. Handwritten digit recognition holds significant im-portance across multiple domains, including finance, postal services, education, and data entry systems. By automating the process of digit recognition, this project aims to enhance efficiency, reduce manual labor, and improve the overall accuracy of data processing tasks.
The MNIST dataset consists of 28x28 pixel images of handwritten digits, along with their correspond-ing numerical labels. Each image is represented as a matrix of pixel intensities, with values ranging from 0 to 255. The task involves training a machine learning model to learn patterns and features from these images, enabling it to accurately predict the digit represented in unseen images.
The complexity of the handwritten digit recognition problem lies in variations in writing styles, stroke thickness, and image quality. Additionally, distinguishing between similar-looking digits presents a sig-nificant challenge for classification algorithms. This project aims to overcome these challenges by im-plementing a two-layer neural network architecture and leveraging techniques such as gradient-based optimization and activation functions like ReLU and sigmoid.
The successful development of an accurate handwritten digit recognition model has the potential to streamline various processes, including check processing, mail sorting, and automated grading systems. It represents a step forward in the advancement of machine learning and computer vision technologies, with practical implications for improving productivity and accuracy in real-world applications.
